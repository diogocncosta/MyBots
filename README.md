ME495: Artificial Life

To run this project please run the file "search.py"

My Project for Assignment 5 has an Octoped that attempts to throw an obstacle to the ground. 
The robot has sensors in all the lower legs and motors in all the lower and upper legs. 
The fitness function works by always opting for the evolution that provides a positional value closer to the obstacle (in this case a higher y value).
Unfortunatelly the agility of the robot has decreased with the added number of legs.
