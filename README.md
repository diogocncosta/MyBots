This Project is done for the ME495: Artificial Life course at Northwestern University The project is inspired by the Ludobots project found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/

In this assignment we create a randomized 3D body by incorporating a random number of rectangular bodies linked to one another in all directions. Some of the bodies have sensors attributed to them. If they do their color is green instead of cyan.

To run this code simply run search.py
